  Raspberry Pi

# Getting started
- clone this repo to your raspberry pi
- run `bower install`
- run `runPiDevServer.sh` (or `runDevServer.sh` on dev machine)
- you should now be able to access the light controller web page at
  your raspberry pi's IP address

# todo
- set dev server address with cmd args
- angular directive for spectrum color picker?
- better colour picker - color & brightness sliders, no choose button
